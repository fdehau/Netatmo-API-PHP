Installation
============

PHP Version
-----------

PHP 5.6+ is required

Composer
--------

The recommended way to install the SDK is with `Composer`_.

You can add the SDK as a dependency using the composer CLI:

.. code-block:: sh

  composer require netatmo/php-sdk

You can also specify the SDK as a dependency in your project's existing
`composer.json`.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "require": {
      "netatmo/php-sdk": "~3.0"
    }
  }

.. _Composer: https://getcomposer.org
